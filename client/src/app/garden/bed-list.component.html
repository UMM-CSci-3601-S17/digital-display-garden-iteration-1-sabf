<!-- We should have ratings on a specific Bed page
rather than on a page that is a list of beds.
They don't/won't have bed information on this page
so it wouldn't really make sense to vote here.
The bed list is not something that will/should be used often
so we shouldn't prioritize it as much as flower and bed pages.

The ratings should be next to where the comments are
